# Task 3: Text Generation

_Use a Python generative AI library to generate simple text sequences such as headlines or product descriptions.
Provide sample outputs and code documentation._


### To start generating simple text sequences, you need to follow these steps:

* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal
* Run file `/happyai/Task 3/main.py`
* Write your prompt in terminal
* To end text generation, enter `Thanks` or press hotkeys `Ctrl+C`





### Examples
```
Prompt: "Generate a clickbait headline for an article about cooking"

Prompt: "Generate a tagline for a new energy drink"
Output: "Rev up your day with Bolt, the energy drink that never quits!"

Prompt: "Generate a short blurb about a new sci-fi novel"
Output: "In a world where time travel is possible, one woman must navigate the dangers of the past to save her future 
in the thrilling new novel, Chrono Clash."
